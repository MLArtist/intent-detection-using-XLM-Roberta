# Intent Detection using XLM-Roberta

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for building an Intent Detection model using the XLM-Roberta architecture. Intent detection is a common task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), where the goal is to determine the intent or purpose behind a user's input.

In this project, we leverage the power of the Hugging Face Transformers library to fine-tune an XLM-Roberta model for intent detection tasks. The model can be used for various applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, and customer support systems.

## Features

- Preprocessing scripts for data preparation.
- Fine-tuning scripts for training the XLM-Roberta model on your dataset.
- Inference code for predicting intents using the trained model.
- Example notebooks and usage instructions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers library
- Other dependencies as specified in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/MLArtist/intent-detection-using-XLM-Roberta.git
   cd intent-detection-using-XLM-Roberta
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Prepare your dataset: You'll need a dataset with labeled examples for intent detection. Use the provided preprocessing scripts to prepare your data.

2. Fine-tune the model: Train the XLM-Roberta model on your dataset using the fine-tuning scripts. You can customize the training parameters to suit your specific task.

3. Inference: Use the trained model for making predictions on new input text to determine the intent.

### Example Notebooks
